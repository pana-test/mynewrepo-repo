In this course we will learn how to develop infrastructure as code for your startup and enterprise. We will also learn to use DevOps tools to deploy our innovation so that the customers can get access to it right away.\nDevOps is an amazing software development methodology that combines software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops) participating together in the entire service life-cycle, from design through the development process to production, it is a set of practices that automate the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster.\nWe will start this course by learning Linux, Git and Docker, the tools most used by DevOps engineers. Then we will shift our focus on how to deploy serverless containers with Terraform on Google Cloud Run, AWS Fargate, and Azure Container Instances. We will also learn how to build continuous integration, delivery and deployment pipelines. At the end of this course we will learn how to do event monitoring and alerting for our cloud deployments.</p>"}},"certification":[{"title":"HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate","url":"https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate/"}],"textBooks":[{"title":"Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners","authors":"Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners by Felix Alvaro","url":"https://www.amazon.com/LINUX-Beginners-Step-Step-Operating-ebook/dp/B01CF1FORK"},{"title":"Learn Version Control with Git: A step-by-step course for the complete beginner","authors":"Tobias GÃ¼nther","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Version-Control-step-step-ebook/dp/B00K54OL8I/ref=sr_1_3"},{"title":"Docker Deep Dive","authors":"Nigel Poulton","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Deep-Dive-Nigel-Poulton-ebook/dp/B01LXWQUFF/ref=sr_1_1"},{"title":"Terraform in Action","authors":"Scott Winkler","url":"https://www.manning.com/books/terraform-in-action"}],"referenceBooks":null,"sections":[{"title":"Linux for Beginners ","serialNumber":1,"weeks":"1 and 2","quiz":{"title":"Linux for Beginners Quiz","week":4},"lineItem":[{"title":"Linux Commands","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 from Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners by Felix Alvaro</p>\n<p>Essential Linux commands: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FiE-zdP9A0c4AHj3IKDKoLmKzfrUeJqBzwJ30KtJQQ/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FiE-zdP9A0c4AHj3IKDKoLmKzfrUeJqBzwJ30KtJQQ/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p>We will use Ubuntu:\n<a href=\"https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0\">https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/run-ubuntu-within-windows-virtualbox-2202098\">https://www.lifewire.com/run-ubuntu-within-windows-virtualbox-2202098</a>  </p>"}}}]},{"title":"Fundamentals of Version Control with Git ","serialNumber":2,"weeks":"3, 4, and 5","quiz":{"title":"Git Quiz ","week":6},"lineItem":[{"title":"Git for Beginners","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 Learn Version Control with Git: A step-by-step course for the complete beginner by Tobias GÃ¼nther </p>\n<p>We will also covers these readings:\n<a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/\">https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/</a>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009600/difference-between-fork-and-branch-on-github\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009600/difference-between-fork-and-branch-on-github</a>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329943/git-branch-fork-fetch-merge-rebase-and-clone-what-are-the-differences\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329943/git-branch-fork-fetch-merge-rebase-and-clone-what-are-the-differences</a>\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing\">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing</a>\n<a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches#Tracking-Branches\">http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches#Tracking-Branches</a> </p>\n<p>For practice: <a href=\"https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1\">https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a> </p>\n<p>Homework:\n<a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science\">https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science</a>  </p>"}}}]},{"title":"Docker Deep Dive ","serialNumber":3,"weeks":"6, and 7","quiz":{"title":"Docker Quiz","week":8},"lineItem":[{"title":"Docker in Depth","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Chapters 1 to 8 of Docker Deep Dive book by Nigel Poulton\nYou will also need to learn the mounting of host directories in the containers.
