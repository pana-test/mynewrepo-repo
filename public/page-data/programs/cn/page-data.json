For many non-technical people, the command line (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of mystery. However, you only have to know a handful of basic commands to start feeling comfortable. In this quarter we will cover the basic commands to get you started.</p>\n<p>From the Linux command line we will move to learning core Docker technologies, including the Docker Engine, Images, Containers, Registries, Networking, Storage, and more. All of the behind the scenes theory will be explained, and all concepts are clearly demonstrated on the command line.</p>\n<p>After we have mastered the containers we will move towards learning Kubernetes. The Kubernetes container orchestration system safely manages the structure and flow of a distributed application, organizing containers and services for maximum efficiency. Kubernetes serves as an operating system for your clusters, eliminating the need to factor the underlying network and server infrastructure into your designs. In this course we will teach you to use Kubernetes to deploy container-based distributed applications. We will start with an overview of Docker and Kubernetes before building your first Kubernetes cluster. We'll gradually expand your initial application, adding features and deepening your knowledge of Kubernetes architecture and operation. We'll explore high-value topics like monitoring, tuning, and scaling. By the end of the quarter you will be able to appear in the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam.</p>"}},"certification":[{"title":"Kubernetes Application Developer","url":"https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/"}],"textBooks":[{"title":"Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners","authors":"Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners by Felix Alvaro","url":"https://www.amazon.com/LINUX-Beginners-Step-Step-Operating-ebook/dp/B01CF1FORK"},{"title":"Docker Deep Dive","authors":"Nigel Poulton","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Deep-Dive-Nigel-Poulton-ebook/dp/B01LXWQUFF/ref=sr_1_1"},{"title":"Kubernetes in Action","authors":"Marko Lukša","url":"https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action"}],"referenceBooks":null,"sections":[{"title":"Cloud Native: The Modern Way to Develop Software ","serialNumber":1,"weeks":"1 and 2","quiz":null,"lineItem":[{"title":"The Future of Cloud Native ","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>What is Cloud-Native?

In this course we will learn how to develop infrastructure as code for your startup and enterprise. We will also learn to use DevOps tools to deploy our innovation so that the customers can get access to it right away.\nDevOps is an amazing software development methodology that combines software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops) participating together in the entire service life-cycle, from design through the development process to production, it is a set of practices that automate the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster.\nWe will start this course by learning Linux, Git and Docker, the tools most used by DevOps engineers. Then we will shift our focus on how to deploy serverless containers with Terraform on Google Cloud Run, AWS Fargate, and Azure Container Instances. We will also learn how to build continuous integration, delivery and deployment pipelines. At the end of this course we will learn how to do event monitoring and alerting for our cloud deployments.</p>"}},"certification":[{"title":"HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate","url":"https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate/"}],"textBooks":[{"title":"Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners","authors":"Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners by Felix Alvaro","url":"https://www.amazon.com/LINUX-Beginners-Step-Step-Operating-ebook/dp/B01CF1FORK"},{"title":"Learn Version Control with Git: A step-by-step course for the complete beginner","authors":"Tobias Günther","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Version-Control-step-step-ebook/dp/B00K54OL8I/ref=sr_1_3"},{"title":"Docker Deep Dive","authors":"Nigel Poulton","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Deep-Dive-Nigel-Poulton-ebook/dp/B01LXWQUFF/ref=sr_1_1"},{"title":"Terraform in Action","authors":"Scott Winkler","url":"https://www.manning.com/books/terraform-in-action"}],"referenceBooks":null,"sections":[{"title":"Linux for Beginners ","serialNumber":1,"weeks":"1 and 2","quiz":{"title":"Linux for Beginners Quiz","week":4},"lineItem":[{"title":"Linux Commands","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 from Linux: Easy Linux for Beginners by Felix Alvaro</p>\n<p>Essential Linux commands: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FiE-zdP9A0c4AHj3IKDKoLmKzfrUeJqBzwJ30KtJQQ/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FiE-zdP9A0c4AHj3IKDKoLmKzfrUeJqBzwJ30KtJQQ/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p>We will use Ubuntu:\n<a href=\"https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0\">https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/run-ubuntu-within-windows-virtualbox-2202098\">https://www.lifewire.com/run-ubuntu-within-windows-virtualbox-2202098</a>  </p>"}}}]},{"title":"Fundamentals of Version Control with Git ","serialNumber":2,"weeks":"3, 4, and 5","quiz":{"title":"Git Quiz ","week":6},"lineItem":[{"title":"Git for Beginners","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 Learn Version Control with Git: A step-by-step course for the complete beginner by Tobias Günther </p>\n<p>We will also covers these readings:\n<a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/\">https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/</a>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009600/difference-between-fork-and-branch-on-github\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009600/difference-between-fork-and-branch-on-github</a>\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329943/git-branch-fork-fetch-merge-rebase-and-clone-what-are-the-differences\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329943/git-branch-fork-fetch-merge-rebase-and-clone-what-are-the-differences</a>\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing\">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing</a>\n<a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches#Tracking-Branches\">http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches#Tracking-Branches</a> </p>\n<p>For practice: <a href=\"https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1\">https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a> </p>\n<p>Homework:\n<a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science\">https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science</a>  </p>"}}}]},{"title":"Docker Deep Dive ","serialNumber":3,"weeks":"6, and 7","quiz":{"title":"Docker Quiz","week":8},"lineItem":[{"title":"Docker in Depth","shortDescription":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Chapters 1 to 8 of Docker Deep Dive book by Nigel Poulton\nYou will also need to learn the mounting of host directories in the containers.
