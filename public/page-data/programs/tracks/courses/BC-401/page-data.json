Once we have a firm grasp of fundamentals of programming we will move towards learning how to program Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity. Then we learn to write a smart contract, which is a computer protocol, intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. It introduces everything needed write smart contracts and build applications that interact with them. Participants will learn about the Ethereum platform, the programming language Solidity, how to use web3 and the Truffle framework and lastly, how to tie everything together.</p>"}},"certification":[{"title":"Certified Blockchain Developer - Ethereum (CBDE)","url":"https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/cbde "}],"textBooks":[{"title":"CBDE Official Exam Study Guide","authors":"Blockchain Training Alliance","url":"https://blockchaintrainingalliance.com/products/cbde-official-exam-study-guide"},{"title":"Solidity Programming Essentials","authors":"Ritesh Modi","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Solidity-Programming-Essentials-beginners-blockchain-ebook/dp/B078YYB2SM/ref=sr_1_1"},{"title":"Solidity Smart Contracts","authors":"Rangel Stoilov","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Solidity-Smart-Contracts-Ethereum-Blockchain-ebook/dp/B07NJ96D9G/ref=sr_1_2"},{"title":"Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps","authors":"Andreas M.
